# RWA-ID Whitepaper

## Overview
RWA-ID is an onchain registry for issuing verifiable, non-transferable (soulbound) identities
for real-world assets, projects, devices, and compliance use cases.

Built on Ethereum + ENS and deployed on Linea, RWA-ID enables:
- Verifiable identity issuance
- Merkle-based allowlists
- Soulbound credential claims
- Multisig-controlled administration

## Architecture
- Registry smart contract (Linea mainnet)
- ENS-based namespaces (e.g. *.rwa-id.eth)
- Merkle roots for scalable allowlists
- Soulbound token issuance

## Security
- Multisig ownership (Safe)
- Admin-gated project configuration
- Deterministic claim verification

## Status
Live Beta on Linea mainnet.
